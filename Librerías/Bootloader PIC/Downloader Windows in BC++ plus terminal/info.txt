   PIC Bootloader + 					Eindhoven, September 2004
   

   Most PIC applications that I develop include serial link to commuciate to some terminal-console program so I 
   thought it would be handy to integrate a serial console into this Bootloader. The console was inspired on the 
   very nice straightforward OC- console by www.castlesoft.de. 
   
   The original bootloader was made by Petr Kolomaznik (Czech Republic). http://www.ehl.cz/pic, 
   email: kolomaznik@ehl.cz. PICbootPlus is based on the Delphi sources (1.0.8.0  25.7.2001) provided 
   by (C)2000-2001 EHL elektronika.

   All enthousiasts developing PIC applications are free to use this software. I have included  the BCB source 
   code for those who like to make something better out of it. Comments are welcome but I cannot guarantee 
   quick response or even any response at all. 

   How to use: Same as bootloader provided by Petr Kolomaznik. The console works immediatly after startup and 
   almost immediatly after bootloading. You may select baudrates for the console independantly from the bootloader.
   The lines on the console will wrap after 40 characters. Non printable ASCII characters  0 and 9 show up as ASCII 254. 

   Version history Bootloader+ :

   V1.01 - Initial version, works with PIC16F87# and .hex files provided with 1.08 EHL bootloader.
   V1.02 - Version also works on W98, NT4 and XP

   Known problems : 

   1. Console not immediatly ready to receive characters after bootload. I think it has 
   something to do with timeout parameters of communication port. I consider this a minor 
   problem, just reset te PIC again.
